In India, G-Sec Bonds are debt instruments issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The government sells the bonds and uses the funds to pay for daily projects, special infrastructure, or military operations. In exchange for investing in the bond, the issuer promises to pay back the principal amount on a predetermined day. Additionally, the issuer also pays a special G-Sec interest rate till that day. Some examples of government securities are dated securities, treasury bills (T-Bills), and treasury bonds.                                 Interest rate benchmarks – also known as reference rates or just benchmark rates – are regularly updated interest rates that are publicly accessible.                        Foreign exchange refers to exchanging the currency of one country for another at prevailing exchange rates.

Funds collected through such tools are typically used to meet short term requirements of the government, hence, to reduce the overall fiscal deficit of a country.
